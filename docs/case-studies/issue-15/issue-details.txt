We have missing listing in README.md of Gemini, also our Agent CLI (https://github.com/link-assistant/agent) actually supports JSON input/output.

Please download all logs and data related about the issue to this repository, make sure we compile that data to `./docs/case-studies/issue-{id}` folder, and use it to do deep case study analysis (also make sure to search online for additional facts and data), in which we will reconstruct timeline/sequence of events, find root causes of the problem, and propose possible solutions.
